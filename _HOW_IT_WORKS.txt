Program flow:
- AppModule is (kind of) starting class
- there is only one endpoint: POST /api/cqrsbus
- in NotesApi.Handler you can find all handlers for queries and command located in NotesApi.Models
- when adding new class or dependency remember to update Autofac/AutofacModule.cs in every project

Warnings:
- be sure that main project is NotesApi.Nancy.SelfHost
- DTO objects properties should be written with small letters (for JS JSON parser)
- database meed little startup (build migration)
